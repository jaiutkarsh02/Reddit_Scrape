This trend is going to end with someone dead and with nootropics being banned and regulated. We all know what happened to PowderCity. 

This kind of user need to be stopped and kicked out for both our own good and probably theirs too.

Nootropics are not recreative drugs, they shouldn't be used like they are. Nootropics are meant to improve our lives more effectively and with lower risks or side effects than conventional medications.

If you want to get a legal high. This is not your place. If you want to experiment with chemicals. This are not the kind you are going to enjoy. Some people really need this. Nobody needs trip reports after one single dose. Nootropics are not about that.

I'm not the owner of this sub, so if you think that I'm wrong, downvote me and I will be the one getting out of here. As an act of coherence I think that this is what I must do given the circumstance. But I still think that we can achieve good things, that we can help each other, that we can improve our mental performance and increase our abilities slowly, subtly and with time. 

And for doing all of that, we need to stop the shit for further spreading. 

You may think that I'm exaggerating. Take a look and make your own judgement:

3,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed.",199,1520472602.0,82q1b6,676,Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,2018-03-08 07:00:02

8,"Many of you may remember the issue that came up with Cerebral Health/Bioscience Nutraceuticals a few months ago, where their choline bitartrate was numbing people's mouths. After sending those samples in to the lab, the tests came back negative for choline bitartrate. We suspected it was choline salacylate, but decided further testing to ascertain the exact compound would not be worth the cost. Unfortunately that was not the last issue to come from Cerebral Health.

A few weeks ago, another Redditor placed an order pyritinol from CH, along with some alpha GPC and oxiracetam. When the order arrived, both the alpha GPC and oxiracetam seemed alright. However, the pyritinol seemed off. Before thinking about it, he took his normal 400mg dose of pyritinol and went out for a mountain bike ride. Within 15-20 minutes he was getting a weird euphoria and detachment. After another couple minutes, his memory gets very fuzzy. 

Eventually his sister found him in the garage in a manic/psychotic state. He was biting his lips very hard, shaking, and holding his fists tight. Eventually he went into seizures when the paramedics came. He was taken to the hospital and seized again while waiting for the doctor. He had a crazed look in his eyes like what you see with people having a psychotic episode on MDPV. He was in the hospital for 4 days.

Not putting two and two together yet, he tried another small dose of pyritinol a few days after getting home, to see what effects came back. Sure enough, he started to get the euphoria and disassociation that he felt before. He also got the same crazed look in his eyes, and same rolling nystagmus. It tasted nothing like pyritinol, but more like burnt plastic. His cognition was off for a while due to the seizures, but he was sure it was the Cerebral Health pyritinol that caused it.

After doing some searching for similar reactions and physical properties online, he came to the conclusion that the compound was most likely a cathinone derivative like MDPV. All the effects fit with an overdose on something like MDPV. Since 400mg is a normal dose for pyritinol, but a massive dose for MDPV, that is most likely what caused the blackout and seizures. Since then he has been having intermittent seizures, and has been back in the hospital 3 times.

After speaking with the other moderators, we decided we needed to send a sample into the lab to get this tested. To prevent any accusations of tampering with the sample, I had another moderator order a whole new bag from them, then send a sample from that into the lab to be tested. So we now have two samples of the compound in question. The original one that sent the Redditor to the hospital, and the separate order we placed right after we became aware of the issue. Today the results came back, and it tested negative for pyritinol. I spoke to Colin at the lab, and he said that the FTIR did not match up at all, and that it was a completely unrelated compound. Due to legal constraints, the lab did not want to do a full workup on the compound apart from confirming it was not pyritinol. So we are going to be sending another sample from the same batch to Dacesafe.org to do a full workup. It will tell us exactly what the compound is, and what purity level it is at.

[Here is the result from Colmeric](http://i.imgur.com/cCOCMUs.jpg)

So in light of this, I suggest that nobody purchases anything from Cerebral Health. This is the second instance in the last 6 months where they have been selling a completely different substance than what it was advertised as. In this particular instance, it could even be a dangerous and illegal substance. Until we do a full workup, I cannot say for sure if this substance was MDPV or another cathinone derivative. However, it is definitely a psychoactive compound other than pyritinol. Obviously a lawyer is going to be brought in by the Redditor that went to the hospital, so I may have to take certain statements down eventually. However, I want everyone to be aware of this serious issue before it potentially puts another person in the hospital!

**EDIT: After further testing, the substance was identified as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).**

17,"Hey r/nootropics!

Nearly two years ago, my brother (best friend) and I began working on NeuroGum, the first sugar-free caffeine + L-theanine nootropic gum. We saw all these other companies charging exorbitant amounts of money simply encapsulating caffeine and L-theanine, and we began brainstorming ways of creating an alternative that was delicious, affordable, and also portable. Beyond that, we wanted a way of making nootropics more accessible to the average consumer.

&nbsp;

So we borrowed some money and began experimenting by putting caffeine and L-theanine into a gum base. Of course, that first iteration tasted terrible and it crumbled apart. After a few unsuccessful attempts, we finally began working with a certified gum chemist, and over a dozen iterations later, we finally found a way of cold compressing:

* 40mg of caffeine
* 60mg of L-theanine
* 30% Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
* 100% Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)

into a piece of gum. Instead of aspartame, we used sorbitol, stevia, and a natural mint + vanilla flavor mix to mask the flavors and created our very own nootropic gum!

&nbsp;
        
I wanted to share to this subreddit because the amazing content here changed my life. We've been working super hard for the last two years and just launched on Indiegogo today. With the money we raise, we can finish our first production run and get our gum out to as many people as possible.

&nbsp;

You can pre-order here on our Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/neurogum

and you can also check out our website at www.neurogum.com!

Once we launch, I promise I'll be back with some coupon codes for everyone here! If there's any questions, feel free to ask! This is my personal account so I'll be lurking in and out between shifts all day.

Cheers guys!

&nbsp;


**EDIT: Wow. I'm absolutely thrilled. Yesterday, our Indiegogo campaign reached our goal, and now we can pay to finish our first production run. It's been such an overwhelming experience receiving feedback, support, and wonderful discussion for all of you here. After we talk with our manufacturer first thing tomorrow morning, we are going to begin working on some stretch goals like different flavors and our L-theanine gum.**

**This subreddit has been so amazing, and I can't be more grateful. Thank you all so much!**
 
**SO, for everyone who has already ordered, we sped up the timeline! We are going to work hard to get the gum shipped out as quickly as possible! We'll finalize the order tomorrow, receive it in two weeks, then set up something to get it out to you. I can't wait for you all to try NeuroGum!**

&nbsp;

**EDIT (PART 2): After feedback, we dropped our price so NeuroGum is less than $3 a pack! Code Redditropics also gives an extra 10% off so you'll get it for even less :)

I recently purchased 100g of what i believed to be Piracetam from Cerebral Health. After 3 days of dosing 2g in the morning i now feel what can only be described as brain damaged. I can no longer form coherent sentences, my memory is, well, ruined! I also find it hard to concentrate on anything which i found alarming so i contacted ""Professor Douglas. J. Phillips"", the owner of CH who i found to be not helpful whatsoever. I mean this guy flat out denied any problems with his products which is a complete lie! He asked about my diet which is fine, i also abstain from drinking alcohol albeit i was a heavy drinker in the past, and had a brief history of Cocaine use but that was years ago. I admitted this to help with Phillip's personal assessment but he stopped playing doctor by then and didn't reply.

After doing a google search on this SOB i found some alarming results:

On August 3, 2001, the Florida Board of Medicine fined him $10,000 and suspended his license for one year, to be followed by two years of probation [3]. Minkoff, a Scientologist, was implicated in the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who allegedly died of malnutrition while in the custody of other Scientologists. Documents in the case indicate that even though Minkoff had never met McPherson, he prescribed sedative medication by telephone to Church of Scientology staff members who had called on her behalf. Although admitting no guilt, Minkoff reached a $100,000 settlement in 1997 in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McPherson's estate.""**

He's not even a professor, just some charlatan who gives people whacky alterative therapy. Anyways there's a growing number of reports detailing peoples' bad experiences with supplements purchased from CH that are not what they say they are. One of which is detailed here:

Whether or not it's Benadryl that i've taken an overdose of is for the doctors to find out. I have pain in my kidney areas and urine smells really foul, not that piss is suppose to smell nice anyway lol. I'm going for a blood test Monday and have been told to bring along the ""Piracetam"" so it can be tested. I have contacted the FDA who are very interested and also want me to send a sample. If there's any long term damage caused i'm not going to give up till this guy is finished!


Mr. Phillips also posts on http://brainmeta.com/forum/ under the pseudonym of ""GodConsciousness"", discrediting any bad experiences as companies merely trying to stain his already bad reputation. LOL! Not to mention his company sponsors the brainmeta forum (facepalm).

Yes, this is my fault and i agree i should have done more research before purchasing but if i can prevent this from happening to someone else i'll be happy.

So there has been some interest in LSD after some posts about microdosing, and I have a lot of experience microdosing on and off as well as experience taking full doses of LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA for the sole purpose of self development.

If you haven't already read my previous post, I have an [LSD trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ajwd6/this_was_the_most_meaningful_experience_of_my/) as well as my MDMA trip report that I [just posted on /r/Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5utmoj/mdma_might_be_the_greatest_therapeutic_substance/).

Some things to consider. DOSAGE MATTERS. Effects do NOT follow a linear scale. In other words. 25mcg is not ""double"" the feeling of 12.5mcg. Also 50mcg is completely different than 100mcg. You could be jittery on one dose and totally focused on another.

---

**Objectives - LSD**

I've been obsessed with self development, so what drew me to psychedelics was a few things. 

* Psychedelics take your essence and allow you to observe it as though you were looking at yourself from the objective perspective of a completely different human being. You gain an insane hyperawareness into your thoughts and behaviors that would take months to truly understand otherwise. Even if you can logically deduce something for yourself in a sober state, psychedelics helps you ***internalize this logic in a significantly more effective way***.
* Psychedelics increases neurogenesis (see below)
* Psychedelics can help rewire synapses that feel extremely hard wired (ie. people often completely quit smoking the day after. Bad habits are significantly easier to understand and reform after the fact, etc)
* Psychedelics make you better appreciate the world around you, which in turn removes the pressure to perform and thus makes you perform better
* Psychedelics help you reform bad habits and put you on a good track towards developing new habits.

Here is an excerpt that summarizes psychedelic effects on neurogenesis:

>LSD does cause an increase in BDNF, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. LSD can be described as polyamorious in that is binds to every single seratonin and dopamine receptor. To have a greater affect on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis you really want activation of the three rectptors mentioned earlier. This is where psilocybin enters the conversation. Psilocybin has greater affinity for the three sites mentioned, and the effect of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity is also greater, because of the selectivity of psilocybin. 

So why LSD over Mushrooms even though mushrooms have an arguably greater effect on neurogenesis? The short answer is control. Shrooms are like a magical train ride into the alien depths of your brain. It could be a good time, it could be a bad time, but once you board there's no getting off. A good trip sitter can help adjust the tracks and get you through a ""bad experience"", but you can't really will yourself into a different mindset as easily.

If you really want to get a scientific understanding of LSD and its effects, please read Dr. Fadiman's book. It has tons of objective studies, quantitative data, etc that backs up the aforementioned bullet points. I'm not going to do your homework for you so take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research if what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. There are dozens of studies out there.

Now to be clear, the chance of having a bad trip on shrooms with a good trip sitter is more rare than you think, and a lot of people say that their ""bad trips"" were incredibly insightful and ultimately productive nonetheless, but some people can't handle the unknown, so it's important to know yourself. Regardless, you will come out of the other side with new insights and what you do with them is up to you.

*TL;DR:* The objective for me was to better understand my flaws and work to overcome the bottlenecks in my own personality to become a better, more intelligent, and more efficient person in my pursuit of self development.


---

**Objectives - MDMA**

At first I wasn't very interested in MDMA, but after doing it I realized it's absolutely incredible in ways that LSD could NEVER be.

* MDMA works on the parts of your brain that regulate fear, empathy, trust, and openness
* MDMA is in the final stages of FDA approval
* MDMA allows you to take the most traumatizing memories of your life and come to terms with them in ways that would take months or years with traditional therapy alone
* MDMA can help you understand and overcome the paralyzing fears of failure, self-doubt, and personal rigidity

---

**Giving my friends LSD/MDMA in therapeutic sessions**

After experiencing all this myself I truly wanted to share it with everyone I knew. I carefully reached out to friends I knew who had major to minor issues with personality, relationships, etc and took them through my protocol.

* One friend went from smoking 1 pack of cigarettes every 2 days to smoking 1 pack every 2 weeks. If she had a little more self control in general i'm certain she could give it up entirely. She was also able to realize that she was in a toxic relationship and leave her crazy bf after realizing some important things during her trip. She also expressed a new appreciation for nature after walking in the park during her trip.
* Another friend who took 250mcg of LSD told me she suddenly realized that the source of her anger had been her father all along, who had left her and her siblings when she was young. She thought that she had come to terms with this but the LSD made her realize it was still deep within her mind and causing her to be constantly angry. It's been more than a month since her trip and she has expressed that she rarely ever gets angry. She also told me that she sees ""through"" people and has extraordinary insight into manipulative behavior whereas before she would take things at face value. She's been able to register for classes after a long hiatus due to her feeling uncertain about her life. She has a lot more confidence now
* Another friend who had severe self-esteem issues due to his constantly disparaging wife realized his self worth and was able to overcome his paralyzing self-deprecation. He is now studying for a certification to go back to work on a subject he's always been passionate about but too afraid to pursue due to his own mental obstacles.
* My best friend and her husband took MDMA and resolved some of the biggest barriers in their relationship practically overnight. Both of them were able to talk so freely about what was on their mind while simultaneously accepting each other that it literally made all their arguments seem petty and moot. Their relationship is still significantly more open and stronger, 4 wees after the fact. They understand each other better and feel like there's more empathy in the relationship.

Why do I do this? There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing people ***reach their fullest potential***. It's a beautiful thing and I love trip sitting.

**Who I am on a microdose**

Microdosing is great because it's subtle enough that no one would notice except you. When I microdose I'm more amped about life, about the task at hand, and have a noticeable improvement in drive and motivation to get shit done. I've realized that I'm more creative; I have better ideas, and my ideas are more fluid and less traditional, I'm appreciably more witty, social, and more of a badass. This is all really subjective but after months of microdosing I am pretty certain I can distinguish the effects that are unique to LSD here. Though I'm typically very introverted and basically glued to my computer at home most of the day, on a microdose I can effortlessly decide to go out, check out events, or decide to do something social that otherwise would take a lot of mental energy.

It's important to know that even on a microdose, *you're still the captain of your own ship and are responsible for the outcome*. It's way easier to have a good time and work towards developing good habits on a microdose, but it's not quick fix where you pop an 1/8th tab and wait for magic to happen. It is merely a catalyst for great things, and microdosing every 3 days will help you build upon smaller successes.

The purpose of microdosing is to put your mind in a ""learning state"" that makes new habits more ""sticky"". And by consistently microdosing and practicing something the stickiness will build up and the habit will remain with you more strongly.

---

**Permanent Outcomes**

I would dare to say that the human being I am now is incredibly different than who I was 4 months ago when I started everything. I'm significantly more aware, more straightforward with people, daring, open, creative, and I definitely give no effs compared to before. I work and I do what I think I need to do without worrying about the outcome as much. I ***completely*** know who I am now, inside and out. I've come to terms with my weaknesses as a person, accepted them, and am learning how to work around them to get what I want. Other weaknesses I've gotten rid of completely. I know why I used to be avoidant, I know why I treated people certain way, and I know what I need to do to shatter my personal boundaries. I'm still a work in progress but the path is clear now, and I'm excited at the opportunity to challenge myself further.

**Eterneraki's Protocol for getting the best out of LSD & MDMA**

I think it's absolutely imperative to do both eventually. They are like yin and yang. LSD takes a scattered room and helps you gain insight from seemingly unrelated thoughts. MDMA makes you accept the things you've had difficulty accepting and makes you realize that things aren't nearly as big of a deal as you once thought. Just fucking go for it.

If you have anger or anxiety issues I recommend MDMA FIRST. Then a week or 2 later you can do LSD.

Prior to either MDMA or LSD take a week to do the following:

* Practice mindfulness meditation (headspace is a great app) for at least 10 minutes every day
* Take 5-10 minutes every night and write a journal entry. Personal reflections, examine your mood and start thinking about what you want to accomplish during your trip
* Start preparing a list of at least 5 questions you would want to ask yourself during the trip. Some questions may include ""What holds me back from X?"" ""Why is my relationship with this person X?"" ""what do I like about myself?"" ""Why am I afraid/worried/etc about X?"" The more specific the better, but general questions are better than no questions
* Clear out the ENTIRE day that you will be tripping. On the day of, silence your phone and get it out of the way. Your trip sitter should ask you the questions you've prepared right after your peak (~4 hours in).
* Journal the night after your trip as well as the next day or 2 afterwards

MDMA Protocol is 100mg (up to 120 if you're on the heavy side), then 60-75mg 2 hours after the first dose. This is basically the same as the MAPS therapy program. Trip will last 4-6 hours

* Mix the powder in a drink (powder is really bitter, juice is better than water). DO NOT CHUG IT or you will feel nauseous when it all hits you at once. Take sips here and there and finish it over a 3-5 minute span of time. Make sure you eat a light meal 2 hours before. Anything more will either delay onset or reduce effects.

LSD Protocol is 150mcg preferably in the morning (the earlier the better). Trip will last 6-8 hours and you will be tired as fuck. 

In both scenarios it's important to be with someone (SOBER) who cares about you.

AFTERWARDS - This is when the real work begins. Take your new insights and realizations and make a plan to practice being a better you. If you want to microdose take 12.5mcg every third day in the morning. You may do this for 10 weeks straight. Microdosing is safe and very few (if any) adverse events have been noticed by the vast majority of people. Continue reflecting, meditating, and documenting your progress. A support system is tremendously helpful.

**Where to buy - precursor vs actual drug**

/r/darknetmarkets

I personally buy from ""pushing taboo"" (look it up)

precursor lsd as far as I know is just as potent/useful. It's a little more expensive though so I prefer to just buy LSD straight up.

---

**Abuse**

Both can be abused but MDMA is significantly easier to abuse. Newbies can take MDMA again a few weeks after the first, but the recommendation is at least 6 weeks. If you've taken MDMA twice in 2 months, you should wait 3 months before your next roll. 4 times a year thereafter is optimal. Any more than that and you risk falling into the abyss (and it's not fun from what I heard).

LSD is so exhausting that you probably will never want to touch the stuff again, but some people still manage to abuse it. 1 full trip every 6 months is more than enough.

Don't be a fucking idiot.

---

**Safety**

[This graph is a good tl;dr](http://imgur.com/KV6TdKM) 
(Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs)

I'm pretty exhausted from writing all of this out but there are numerous studies on the safety profile of LSD, MDMA, and shrooms. They're completely safe when not abused. Be aware of potential drug interactions if you're on SSRIs or something else.

49,"Hey!

Welcome to /r/nootropics, a subreddit that focuses on enhancing the brain through different methods (pills, exercise, meditation, anything). We'll hopefully be able to help you with your problems and get the extra edge you're most likely looking for. 

So first some background, it all started with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea 40-50 years ago (it didn't really, but the history is easier this way). In the 60's Dr. Giurgea first synthesised piracetam, the now well known drug. For almost a decade he must have thought ""Hmm, how can I become more famous, make up a new word and start a new class of drugs?"" and then it finally hit him! If he made up a new word, added some criterias and then published it, he had it all figured out! So in 1972 he published a study that first used the word nootropic (which means to bend the mind) and decided on some criterias. The criterias are:

1.    They should enhance learning and memory.
2.    They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
3.    They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine).
4.    They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5.    They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

To make it easier for you, most people don't use this definition, ""nootropics"" is commonly used as ""cognitive enhancers"" (which might be neurotoxic, have serious sides, etc). I would like for everyone to stop doing this, but it will obviously not happen but please try. 

The real history goes way back. Humans have always been trying to improve their wetware, Ayurvedic, Shamanism, Chinese, Korean, Siddha, Tibetian, etc have all had herbs and the like to enhance cognition in some ways. That's all I'll say, I know way too little about it. 

You've now decided to start on your noot (short for nootropic) and improvement journey, great! We're glad to have you! But first of all I want to give you realistic expectations. Most noots will not be super noticable or enhance any brain function by a lot, we're just not there yet. Some drugs that seem insanly good in animal models do not transfer to humans at all. Then we have the problem with noots that you do not feel, but still ""works"" (an example for me would be [LLLT](http://www.gwern.net/LLLT)). But as always, people do not respond identically to drugs, you need to try things to know for sure. If you want to feel something you will most likely need to try stimulants or potentially an anxiolytic if you've got anxiety. Also be cautious of interactions, search and read lots before you add new things.

So now that you realise that noots aren't anything like NZT-48 in the movie Limitless we can move on. 


Before you start supplementing things you should get your lifestyle in order. The first thing you should take care of is your sleep. Try to get your +-8 hours and enhance the quality. When you got that in order you should start exercising, both cardiovascular (which got a lot proof for being a cognitive enhancer) and strength (not as much evidence, but more is coming). Try to be active during the day (try not to sit all day, exercise for one hour and think you're good), it'll help sleep and everything in your life. When you're done with those two things you have a good foundation, but adding meditation will help even more. It'll help with any anxiety you have, make you happier and a lot more (cognitive enhancing things). If you don't want to try meditation for some reason, look into neurofeedback. If you do not know how to fix these things, check /r/fitness, /r/meditation and /r/sleep, just check our sidebar relevant subreddits. 

When you got that fixed you could look into your diet. This part is super controversial due to different schools of thought. First we have the more mainstream, low GI-carbs, lots of ""good"" fats, lowish saturated, etc. But we also got a bit of the opposite (/r/keto), low carb, high fat (any except for transfats), etc. This forces the body to go into ketosis (your cells run on more ketones (except for a few cells)) which might hold some benefit for different populations. There's some research hinting towards being in ketosis might be good if you have blood sugar issues (which might cause alzheimer's later in life and cell damage all through), but to me, it does not seem to hold more promise than that. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but you need to make up your own mind and do what you want and find practical. Something almost everyone seems to agree on is that veggies and fruits (ketoers does not like the last one as much as veggies), this is backed up by a lot of research. This is due to multiple things, one of which is that veggies and fruits contain a lot of polyphenols with unique effects. Broccoli has been shown to reduce the effects of (some aspects of) autism, blueberries have shown to fight alzheimer's, etc. 

There's also a bunch of supplements that are usually not seen as noots but still have positive effects. The first group would be vitamins. There are a few that most people are deficent in, mainly vitamin K and D. Vitamin K (in the form of K1) is usually just found in leafy greens and K2 (which we usually prefer to supplement) in a few fermented foods. The health effects are quite important for preventing cardiovascular, bone and potentially neurological problems. Vitamin D has in recent years been promoted as the cure all, which it's obviously not. It is however very good for you. There are a lot of correlations between auto-immune diseases and higher mortality in vitamin D deficent people. Adding 2000-5000 IU of D3 daily (and keeping your blood levels checked) should fix the deficency for most people. 

If we move within the group micronutrients, but don't look at vitamins, we find minerals. The most significant in this category (relevant to us) is magnesium. To describe it in simple terms, it helps you calm down, promotes synaptic plasticity, help depression, long-term memory and a gazallion other things related to enzymes. If you take it before sleep you'll get better sleep quality and fall asleep faster. There are however forms that have been shown to be fairly worthless, mainly magnesium oxide. You will have to look up what form you want to supplement with. Just be sure to not take too high doses, it might act as a laxative!

Another mineral worth checking out is zinc. Deficency might lower testosterone and BDNF levels, both which are highly correlated with depression and cognitive functions. Doing too much might have opposite effects on BDNF levels and be toxic, so try to not overdo it. A normal starting dose would be around 15-25 mg, adding copper at other times might also be worth looking into. 

If we leave the micronutrients and look into other supplements that are worth looking into, we quickly find creatine. /u/silverhydra calls it a pseudovitamin (because real defiency results in retardation) which means we must look into it! Creatine is a molecule with a phosphate group bound to itself, if you remember your high school biology you'll remember that ATP becomes ADP and needs a new phosphate group to become ATP again. Guess where you can get that group from? Exactly, creatine! When your cells use up ATP your creatine phosphate donates its group and regenerates ATP. This has been found to be extra effective for vegetarians who consume small quantities of creatine. They are one of the few groups that actually might get an IQ increase from adding it! Other groups that would benefit from it would be elders, sleep deprived and potentially everyone else. It's neuroprotective, might raise your IQ, might make you live longer, modulates a billion things, there's really no reason not to take it. 

You've probably browsed multiple sites for starting your stack and then found /r/nootropics, so you want us to help you get started. Sure can do! There are four beginner stacks usually mentioned, the caffeine + theanine, noopept, bacopa and the piracetam (+ choline).

But something important before you order ANYTHING, get a damn milligram scale! As you're most likely not doing anything that requires exact measurements, something cheap like Gemini-20  will work. It will run you about $20 and will last you a very long time. This is for your own safety only (and I know you'll get hate/no help if you create a thread asking about what 200 mg looks like in powder form). Be also cautious with what source you use. Scammers pop up all the time in the noot world, some selling things that have caused hospitalisation. Check the sidebar for suppliers that are trusted, a guideline is to mainly buy from sellers than can provide third part CoAs (Certificate of Analysis). 

Have you heard about theanine before? If you have, it has probably been in the context of tea. If you have not, theanine is an amino acid analogue that we mainly find in tea. Why are we adding it to our lovely caffeine? Theanine seems to induce a state of calm, but still keep you alert/awake. Adding caffeine to it boosts the alert/awake, thus making the caffeine nicer for you. There are multiple studies on the combo with positive results (and on the individual compounds). If you're already drinking coffee you can pour some theanine in your cup and enjoy it more. The commonly recommended ratio between theanine and caffeine is 2:1 T:C. But be sure to play around with the ratio to see what works best for you. A good starting dose would be 50-100 mg caffeine and 100-200 mg theanine. 


Maybe you don't want to use caffeine, you want to expand your stack or have some other reason to add other things. Then you might want to start with piracetam and choline.  This stack has less scientific, but a fair amount of anecdotal evidence (if you care about that). Piracetam was first synthesised by Dr. Giurgea and his team and had some success. The mechanism is not fully understod yet (as with many other drugs) and some argue it's mainly good for the older population, fighting off the age related decline in brain function. The choline is added because one of the mechanisms seems to be cholinergic (the scientific evidence for adding it is weak, anecdotal is not as weak, but still not that strong). When you're adding choline you should be mind the dose. Too high dosages seem to induce depression in a lot of people. The dosage here is a bit more spread between users. Piracetam is taken in doses between 800-4800 mg, 1-3 times a day and choline is taken at doses around 200-1000 mg depending on form. You should however not buy any form of choline, there are better and worse sources. The worst source is choline bitartrate, which should be the last waw out (get some other form if you can). The better forms are Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline. You should try with and without choline to make sure how you respond to them. Try adding them one at a time, as you should with any supplement. 

Maybe you don't like the former ones, maybe want to try new things or maybe have some interest Russian drugs. Then you might be interested in noopept, a dipeptide. The evidence is even less for noopept, basically zero in humans in the western world. The mechanism for this one is even less researched. The doses for this compound is 5-30 mg 1-3x daily, orally or sublingual. Too high doses seem to impair working memory for some people, so it's best to start low. One of the creators have been interview by Smart Drug Smarts which you can listen to [here](http://smartdrugsmarts.com/rita-ostrovskaya-noopept/). 

Maybe you're one of those people who prefer to take ""natural"" things, then we have a herb for you! The herb I'm talking about is the adaptogenic herb Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for many years, but as with the other drugs, the mechanism is still not fully understod. The dose used is usually 300-500 mg if it's 50% bacosides. Don't get sad if you don't notice any effects right away, it takes time for it to work. Most trials with good results take it for weeks, it's usually recommended to be taken for atleast 8 weeks, then people usually start noticing it. 

There are lots of pre-made stacks, but almost all of them have the same problem, under dosed/don't tell the dose, over priced and no proof that the things they use are pure. So research A LOT before buying them.


As I've written before, there are non-supplemental ways to enhance your cognition. Remember the thing I talked about when I said it was important to measure things? It was LLLT, also called Low-Level Laser/LED/Light Therapy. It sounds like something a hippie made up, but there is a lot of evidence behind it. LLLT works by using a light source (in the 600-1000 nm range) and shining it where you want (in my case the skull (for the brain)). The photons are absorbed by cytochrome C which increases its activity and thus increase ATP production. It does a whole lot more related to it and has been shown to improve reaction time, improve memory, etc. For more info you should search this subreddit and get over to lostfalco's thread on longecity. Another thing that is a bit more risk would be tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation. Exactly how and how good it works is fairly unknown, but preliminary data hints at some great results. If you want a high quality unit you will need to spend a few hundred bucks, if you can build one you'll save a lot. There's really no way to explain this without going overboard (placement, intensity, hormones and a lot of other things plays a role in the effect), so head over to /r/tDCS if you're interested. 

There are also other ways that just requires your computer, so called brain games! The current brain game that has most evidence is n-back. To keep it short a few studies has shown that it increases working memory and potentially IQ (which is disputed), it's one of the few games that have evidence behind it. The most common form is dual-n-back, where you are keeping track of a sound and a position. If you want to learn more, /u/gwern has by far the best papers on it which you can read [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) and [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis).

This is also a good way to keep measuring how effective some of your noots are. Other brain games have not shown as much potential, but can be a way to measure progress. Sites that offers these are [Luminosity](http://www.lumosity.com/ ) (Paid) and [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ ) (Free), simple apps for reaction time are also worth looking at.

51,"Hey again. [After reading through the comments on my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/630czc/guide_to_healing_your_gut/), I got the impression that a lot of you thought the supplement regimen was too much and didn't like the idea of pounding a bunch of capsules every few hours(which I totally understand, but sometimes depression, anxiety, and IBS can make you desperate enough to do so). My intention with the post was to help people who need an overall solution to an incredibly stubborn problem, and attack it from all angles. While it might seem like overkill to some folks, I think we forget how persistent and relentless an IBS problem can be, and I believe its primarily due to the gut mucosal layer and intestinal microvillus not being there to keep the flora intact, typically as a result of bad diet. While I still think there quite a bit value in taking all these supplements together, I don’t think it is required for long term use if you eat properly after starting it. Once you get the gut back to being completely healthy and diverse with the proper flora, it goes back to what it was like when you were a kid; eating a poptart and a pepsi for breakfast everyday and shitting just fine. Not saying you should do that, but having good gut health allows you to have some fun sometimes and not worry the next day. That’s a really valuable thing, at least it is for me. 

**Probiotics**

One of the primary reasons why I suggested the GOL(34 Strain 100+ billion CFU) probiotic was because of the amount of strain variety you get. While there may be negligible amounts of some of the latter strains, with the proper prebiotic fiber, they can still flourish and populate your gut effectively with many different cognitively beneficial strains of bacteria that aren't as available in food(not to mention how gross some fermented food is). With Probotic drinks or foods, you often don't get as much variety and nor do you get the exact details of which strains are populated within. Kefir tends to produce a lot of the Lactobacillus strains that can exacerbate histamine issues, and thus allergies/inflammation. Kombucha's bacteria profile has some bad strains like Candida which can often make high sugar/fructose diet floras much worse, as candida loves it sugar... In its entirety, its great stuff that everyone should be drinking IN ADDITION to probiotic supplementation (but not at the exact same time - probiotic in the morning/kombucha at night). Considering that, it's incredibly hard to get a diverse microflora when just relying on food. You'd need to consume all kinds of things such as Kefir, Natto, Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Kombucha, Greek Yogurt, and a handful of others. Personally, I'd rather just take a high strain/CFU probiotic daily and consume those other probiotics sources a few times a week. We want to cover all the bases right? Flora diversity, intestinal mucosa, and microvillus health are all dependent on each other – we need gut homeostasis and equilibrium if we want the cognitive benefits too. 

**Intestinal and Mental Health**

As some of you may know, the ""leaky gut"" label has gotten a bit of criticism as of late for its overuse with Naturopaths and other pseudoscience based health advisers. While I still think there is a massive amount of research to be done to confirm its validity, it's safe to say that there are strong correlations between gutflora/intestinal health and all kinds of life debilitating neurological disorders. This is an emerging science that I believe is on the brink of changing how we look at healthcare. There is a second brain in our body, and what you feed that brain has profound effects on your overall health and equally your perception of reality. What happened to the old saying ""you are what you eat""? If you consume a diet that is high in fat and sugar, your stomach bacteria will be fundamentally different than someone who is on a vegan diet. If you were to take two identical twins from the same starting age and feed one a high sugar/carb diet with little fiber and the other a perfect Paleo/Mediterranean diet high in fiber and good fats, they would turn out to be two fundamentally different people cognitively and behaviorally. I could almost guarantee that the kid with the high carb processed diet would turn out with less mental acuity, emotional intelligence, and overall health. He’d probably get an ADHD diagnosis early, and may even exhibit symptoms on the autistic spectrum before he hits puberty. What if this is entirely implicated by your gut bacteria and diet? What if the antibiotics that he took when he was 10 permanently destroyed a strain of bacteria in his gut that was benefiting him cognitively, and he was never the same after? I dunno about some of you, but I fell into a deep depression coincidentally after I had done a couple years of antibiotics and I’m still slowly getting my shit together. If gut bacteria and intestinal health are important enough to effect neurotransmitter levels, BDNF production, neurogenesis, and other beneficial cognitive functions, then shouldn’t our goal be to have a healthy flora above all else?

The more I read about this, the more I feel like we have been misled and unjustly coerced into an unhappy life through the diets forced on us via advertising and grocery store isles. If you look at how food affects you neurologically, then it’s safe to say that the typical American diet is probably one of the “most addicting”. Sugar is addicting, period. It light’s your brain up the exact same way that cocaine does and while it doesn’t have the same systemic addictive effects, you certainly have withdrawals if you cut a 500g a day sugar habit to 0. Same goes for fatty or unhealthy processed food. The goal of any bacteria is to grow and populate. It’s in the gut bacteria’s evolutionary best interest to continue pumping out feel good neurotransmitters that your brain likes, so your brain will associate that food with positive emotions and try to maintain the cycle. Does it suffice to say that your second brain might have some control over you?  





**Dietary Suggestions and Supplemental Alternatives**

Everyone should already be taking magnesium, vitamin D, and digestive enzymes. You can’t get NAG from diet, so this is only thing I'd recommend supplementing. If you want the maximum benefits, then please eat right while introducing these strains of bacteria into your gut. Taking probiotics with a bad diet isn’t a good idea in my opinion. You risk the chance of developing worse problems if one of the “good strains” gets out of whack too and wreaks havoc on your immune system or inflammatory process. Paleo/Mediterranean diet is what I’d recommend following being that keto can be a tad low on fiber. You want lots of diverse plant fibers from fruit, vegetables, and nuts - as well as the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects produced with green leafy vegetables.

**Final Notes**

I know this seems like a lot of work, and for those of you who have severe anxiety or depression, I understand wholeheartedly how hard keeping up with this shit is. I’ve been through several cycles of diets, nootropics, addictions, and exercise phases, and I was never able to maintain it. I would always relapse to bad habits out of need for immediate comfort. That’s the bitch about depression and anxiety. You know what you need to do and you know what steps are required to make your life better, but you just can’t find the mental motivation to do it. I believe discipline is a muscle of consciousness and if you don’t exercise daily, it atrophies. If there is one nootropic that helps exercise this discipline muscle and maintain good habits, it’d be P21(with meditation). I’ve taken it on/off for just over a month now, and its effects on my mental willpower have been completely unmatched. I no longer sit and ruminate with procrastinating anxiety about all the shit I needed to do, I just fucking do it now because I know I’m investing in my future happiness and it'll be worth it long term(as cheesy as that sounds). Being content used to be my only goal in life, and now I realize how pointless that is. You need goals and struggle to reach those truly rewarding happy moments, everything can't be great all the time. So take 2 weeks and plan out every meal, supplement, meditation session, and exercise routine and follow it precisely. Just know that while you feel shitty and anxiety ridden right now, I can almost guarantee at the end of the 2 week mark you’ll feel better than you ever have and you'll want to continue some of the habits you've learned. If you fall back into depression, so be it, just learn something while you try to claw your way back out again. Eventually it'll come together. :)

53,"Unfortunately, I have some bad news. Jason (/u/Guacamolium), my business partner and co-founder of Ceretropic has died. He was found dead in his apartment on Friday afternoon. He had not come in for a few days, and was not answering his phone. I got a little worried, so /u/Synzael and I decided to go check on him. After he did not answer, we decided to get the police to come down. When they entered his apartment, they found him dead inside.

The toxicology screen will not be back for a few weeks. However, Jason had been having a few problems with Xanax and drinking. He was never one to be careful with his own safety, and would often have horrible insomnia. This led to him turning to Xanax and alcohol to try and get a little bit of sleep some nights. I let him know how irresponsible that was, but he never really got the message. There were a few occasions that I found him passed out after taking too much. I made him get into a substance abuse program, which he had been going to regularly. However, I never felt he was taking it seriously enough. I had hoped that he had things under control, but always feared that something would happen. I just figured it would be him getting in trouble, or driving on it and getting in an accident. I never expected the worst.

I know a lot of you spoke to Jason often about all manner of things. He was a very intelligent person, with a lot of great ideas. This is a big loss for Ceretropic, and the community as a whole. We would always have long sessions, where we would bounce new ideas off each other. Our personalities worked very well together for coming up with new compounds. He would always be sort of out there with optimism, and I would bring a healthy level of pragmatism to the equation; which led to a good creative environment. It's going to be very different without him around.

Anyone out there that has someone they know that is going through a tough time, please take the time to try and help them. **People in general, but especially us in the nootropic community, like to see ourselves as invincible. We never consider the possibility that one wrong measurement could be the end of us. I think this should be a wake up call for many of us out there being a little too cavalier with our safety. You never know what moment could be your last.** I wish I could have been a better friend to Jason, and possibly helped prevent this from happening. However, I know that hindsight is always 20/20. I hope that this incident can help us all to strive to be more careful with our safety, and reach out to those that we know need a little help. Jason was a very good guy, and he will be missed.

55,"I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but fuck it. It's my opinion and I need to express it:

I really think that a lot of people here underestimate the potency of the placebo effect. I see these threads about how l-theanine ""cured"" somebody's crippling anxiety, or how they used to be a loser but since taking piracetam all the sudden they are super smart and shit, and I cannot help but feel very skeptical towards such claims.

I know very well that a specific substance can work even if you don't ""feel"" anything. I also know that people have different brain chemistry, etc. 
But consider this:

People tend to think that they are immune to placebo, but that's simply not the case. Nobody is. Even the smartest person in the world can get fed an illusion. The placebo effect is very, **VERY** powerful and should definitely not be underestimated.

We would definitely benefit from more double-blind self-tests à la Gwern.


Therefore, unless you do rigorous double-blinded self-experiments to eliminate, or at the very least -limit- the possibility of placebo effect, please don't tell people how ""l-theanine **definitely** cured my anxiety !!!!1!!1"" and use words such as ""seems to"" and ""may have"" more often.",165,1454904989.0,44ncd7,310,I believe an important amount of posters in this subreddit GREATLY underestimate the placebo effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/44ncd7/i_believe_an_important_amount_of_posters_in_this/,2016-02-08 09:46:29

61,"This board excels at finding ""new"" substances, compiling threads with many reports on a given substance, researching how it impacts the brain, and adding valuable user experiences. Yet many of the reports are in conflict, and there is no consensus on the general efficacy of almost anything - this is because the missing half of the equation is you.


The medical field also suffers from this: its tools are blunt sledgehammers like benzos, tricyclics and SNRI/NDRIs that may fix 2-3 things while breaking two (often more) previously balanced systems. Even things as ubiquitous seeming as ADD, ADHD and Anxiety are being recognized as having many possible causes (and consequently, sub-types). 


There is little mystery as to how things like 5-HTP, Picamilon or Choline will impact ""the brain"". What's missing is the guide which will let people find out how they will impact THEIR brain. To solve this, we need to shift from substance-centric to neurochemistry-centric discussion. For now, I'm simply encouraging every user to do their own research.

62,"TL;DR at the bottom

Background story: Ever since hitting puberty, I've experienced a great deal of anxiety, both generalized and social. I always knew something was just not right with me, only later to find out I have Asperger's. People with this condition tend to have some special interests they obsess over, and something I love researching/experimenting with is nootropics. My main goal was getting my anxiety and moods under control, and I've tried dozens and dozens of nootropics/vitamins/supplements for this reason. I've experimented with many other nootropics for memory/cognitive-enhancement/mental-sharpness, but for the sake of this post, I will talk about ones that have helped me with anxiety. I've noticed many subscribers of this subreddit also suffer from anxiety, and a calm mind is one of the best nootropics there is IMO. This community is awesome and has helped me a lot, so hopefully this post will help someone else! I rated each of them in terms of personal anxiety relief. Remember, what didn't work for me might work for you, and vice versa. I just realized halfway through writing this that its a really long post, so I'll break it up into a few parts instead for time purposes.

-Bacopa (7/10): My first nootropic experience, and it was a good one. I noticed acute effects of lowered anxiety, and over the course of a few months noticed increased memory. This amazing herb is subltle enough that I feel normal, but noticable enough that I felt less stress and anxiety. I didn't even realize how great it was until I got off of it, and started experienceing my usual increased anxiety. It wasnt like an acute ""Wow, I feel so calm"" feeling, more like a background calm. Like turning down the volume of anxiety a couple of notches. Looking back at it, the 6-7 months I used it I was in a much better place mentally.

-Theanine (2/10): I know this is very popular in this subreddit, but personally I felt no noticable effects from it. I've tried suntheanine, and a few other brands since it is pretty hyped on here and similar forums, but unfortunately I'm just personally a non-responder. I would recommend trying this if you suffer from anxiety, since many people find it helps them. 

-Phenibut(10/10): My holy grail of social anxiety relief. The first time I took it was absolutely mind blowing. I was about 17 working at a supermarket bagging groceries (LOL) and dealing with terrible anxiety, especially social anxiety; talking to customers all day made me very on edge all day and mentally drained at the end of the day. I tried a 1 gram dose of phenibut, and 4 hours later, I felt the best I have ever felt in my life. ""The world was my playground"" is quote from a fellow redditor that perfectly describes my experience with this substance. I was flirting with girls, hi-fiving everybody, and just felt fucking awesome. Like I just felt great to be alive, everyone felt like a good friend, and I was so charming/whitty/outgoing. Unfortunately as many of you already know, these effects are not sustainable with regular use and rebound anxiety is a bitch. Fortunately, this led me to research the mechanisms of action of phenibut and Gaba-B, which led to my discovery of the following substance.

-Baclofen(10/10): Not really a nootropic, but it felt identical to phenibut. Whats even better, I was able to take it regularly and keep the anxiety-reducing benefits of phenibut without the extreme tolerance and other side effects. I'm convinced I have some kind of gaba-B dysfuntion, because baclofen causes me to feel normal. I'm more comfortable in social situations, and its effects on empathy and mood have made this an absolute staple for me.

-Kava-Kava (6/10): First I tried cheap Kava, then was told I have to make my own kava from a good powder. My experiences were not that great: terrible taste, headaches, and groggyness were the main effects I got from this. Oh, and a slight anxiety reduction. I have read that kava has a reverse tolerance(meaning the longer you take it, the stronger the effects are). I want to continue experimenting with this though, because I dont believe I've taken it for long enough periods and maybe my quality of root was not that great.

-Picamilon(4/10): Another popular anxiety nootropic, unfortunately it didnt do much for me. I've read many people are not very impressed with it either, howevery YMMV.

-N-acetyl-cystine(9/10): This stuff is awesome, and is another staple for me. My experience with NAC is less intrusive thoughts, decrease in impulsiveness, and it literally CURED my trichtillomania. It also prevents hangovers for me when taken a couple of hours before a night out drinking with friends.

-Memantine (7/10): For the first few days, I felt amazing on it. I definitely felt an increased mood and decreased anxiety. Those effects subdued, and I was left with some mood stabilization and tolerance reduction to stimulants.

-Colouracetam(7/10): This is my favorite racetam. I feel an increase in mood and a nice, clear, calm mind. For some reason, Ceretropic's sublingual version is the only one that I feel noticable effects from. I will probably end up buying some bulk powder from them, because I'm thinking maybe I just got some bunk powder from the other vendor I tried.

-Noopept(6/10): This stuff has such a psychedelic vibe for me. An increase in colors and an appreciation for scenery (LOL) are the main effects I felt from it. It didnt do too much for my anxiety, but I did find taking it sublingually helped my verbal fluidity in social situations, so that definetly a plus.

-Aniracetam (6/10): This is a popular racetam that many users descibe as being anxiolytic. Besides the first few doses, it did not do too much for my anxiety personally. I even tried taking it with Omega-3 as someone suggested to me, and still nothing too noticeable. I may try this one again, maybe this time with a regular 3x daily dosage. The only effect that I really enjoyed was making music sound better, and that also faded after the first few doses.

-Phosphatidylserine (8/10): I know that the bovine sources are not used anymore for this supplement and other sources of it do not have very good research, but it made a pretty big impact as far as stress reduction for me. I felt less physical anxiety in social situations, and did not get as hot as I would during social interaction. Normally I would start sweating bullets, my voice would crack, and people who shook my hand would ask me why my palms were so sweaty. lol

I was initially going to write all my experiences but didnt realize how long this post became. This is only a fraction of my experiences, and I will write up the rest if anyone is interested. Off the top of my head, I have also tried bromantane, ashwaghanda, emoxypine, etifoxine, holy basil, low dose naltrexone, tianeptine, klonopin, semax, inositol, DMAE, galantamine, PEA, 5-HTP, gabapentin, rhodiola, kratom, L-tryptophan/tyrosine, and some others as well.

64,"Hey everyone. Recently there was a post about the relation between gut health and mental health, and it piqued my interest in creating a stack to help facilitate healing and microbriome regrowth. After diving into google scholar articles and acknowledging the relation between gut health and mental acuity, I'm convinced this is the best stack to assist with repairing your microbiome and gut health. I started a variation of this stack a couple months ago in addition to some other noots/peptides, and it's made some subtle but perceptible improvements in my life already. Hopefully it helps ya'll too. 


**Studies**

* [Stress & the gut-brain axis: Regulation by the microbiome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289516300509)
 * The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations.
 * Several lines of evidence support the suggestion that gut microbiota influence stress-related behaviours, including those relevant to anxiety and depression. Work using germ-free (GF) mice (i.e., delivered surgically and raised in sterile isolators with no microbial exposure) demonstrates a link between microbiota and anxiety-like behaviour (Neufeld et al., 2011; Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011 ;  Clarke et al., 2013). In particular, reduced anxiety-like behaviour in GF mice was shown in the light-dark box test and in the elevated plus maze (see (Luczynski et al., 2016a) for review). On the other hand, GF rats display the opposite phenotype, and are characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour (Crumeyrolle-Arias et al., 2014). Interestingly, the transfer of stress-prone Balb/C microbiota to GF Swiss Webster (SW) mice has been shown to increase anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal SW mice, while transfer of SW microbiota to GF Balb/C mice reduced anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal Balb/C mice suggesting a direct role for microbiota composition in behaviour (Bercik et al., 201
 * Gene expression within the hippocampus also is markedly different in GF mice compared to normal controls. The hippocampus exerts strong control over the HPA stress axis, and GF mice are characterized by markedly increased hippocampal 5-HT concentrations (Clarke et al., 2013), accompanied by decreased 5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the dentate gyrus in female (but not male) GF mice (Neufeld et al., 2011). Intriguingly, other CNS alterations in GF mice also are sex-dependent; e.g., altered expression of BDNF has been documented only in male GF mice (Clarke et al., 2013). BDNF is an important plasticity-related protein that promotes neuronal growth, development and survival, with key roles in learning, memory and mood regulation. BDNF gene expression is lower in the cortex and amygdala in male GF mice compared with controls (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), whereas hippocampal BDNF levels in GF mice have been reported to either increase (Neufeld et al., 2011) or decrease (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2013 ;  Sudo et al., 2004).
 * Therefore, gut microbiota may play a crucial role in tryptophan availability and metabolism to consequently impact central 5-HT concentrations. Although the specific mechanisms underlying this putative modulatory interaction are unknown, they are potentially mediated indirectly through an immune-related mechanism linked to microbial colonization 
 * **Animal studies have led the way in showing that specific strains of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus or Bacteroides can have positive effects on brain and behaviour ( Hsiao et al., 2013; Bravo et al., 2011; Bercik et al., 2011b; Savignac et al., 2014 ;  Savignac et al., 2015), including evidence that certain bacteria can enhance cognitive processes and affect emotional learning**


* [Gut–brain axis: how the microbiome influences anxiety and depression](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/60c0/58682d907fe80befc23e58f279d34ade23f1.pdf)
 * Significant progress has been made over the past decade in
recognizing the importance of gut microbiota to brain
function. Key findings show that stress influences the
composition of the gut microbiota and that bidirectional
communication between microbiota and the CNS influences
stress reactivity. Several studies have shown that
microbiota influence behavior and that immune challenges
that influence anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are
associated with alterations in microbiota. Emerging work
notes that alterations in microbiota modulate plasticityrelated,
serotonergic, and GABAergic signaling systems in
the CNS. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity
to consider how the gut–brain axis and, in particular, new
tools will allow researchers to understand how dysbiosis of
the microbiome influences mental illness.


* [A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159115000884)
 *  We found that a 4-week multispecies probiotic intervention reduced self-reported cognitive reactivity to sad mood, as indexed by the LEIDS-r (van der Does and Williams, 2003; van der Does, 2005 ;  Kruijt et al., 2013). Further analyses showed that the strongest beneficial effects were observed for the aggression and rumination subscales, indicating that in the probiotics supplementation condition participants perceived themselves to be less distracted by aggressive and ruminative thoughts when in a sad mood.

**Forgot to mention EDIT:** For those of you who eat a lot of bad food, be aware of a possible Herxheimer reaction if cutting a lot of sugar/carbs in conjunction with this stack. A year ago, I went hard into keto after being on a very high sugar/high carb diet, and I had what is typically called ""the keto flu"", but I believe this effect is more due to the massive die off of bacteria in your gut that feeds on sugars and carbs. I've had a few friends try this similar stack(high sugar diets), and have a ""sick"" couple of days in the beginning even though they only cut back on some sugary stuff. Light migraine, sore throat/tonsils, and general fatigue. Feels like a 100% manageable flu, but it's still unpleasant. Anti-inflammatory supplements help with this but only so much. This typically lasts a day or two. 


**FINAL EDIT Summary:** 

I think this stack covers a large majority of the bases required to propagate gut flora and increase general intestinal health, while providing nootropic benefits in relation to social fluidity, mood, mental energy, and emotional health. Starting with the probiotic, I chose Garden of Life(100 Billion CFU) for a variety of reasons. First it has all the popular beneficial strains, in addition to a diverse amount of subtly mood boosting strains. After doing some googling, it looks like there is a decent balance between the histamine increasing/reducing, the immuno-modulator, nutrient absorption promoting, mood boosting, anti inflammatory, and  stool improving strains. Taking GOL in addition to the prebiotic strain from Vitamin Shoppe provides all the prebiotic goodness to help facilitate the beneficial flora to grow and actually populate the gut long term. 


Glutamine, NAG, Quercetin, Collagen, and Aloe Vera juice all help grow the intestinal mucosa back to its normal state, and regrow the Microvillus that gets damaged with chronic bowel disease. For the good bacteria to stick around long term, it needs that mucous layer for protection. Another important factor that most people overlook in gut health is digestive enzymes. Certain strains of bacteria can change the acidity of your stomach and intestines, which can cause all sorts of problems with digestive effectiveness and as a result, your nutrient absorption. Super enzymes are a staple in any one of my stacks, simply because you can never digest food too well, right? The last 3 supplements are Caprylic Acid/Coconut Oil, Omega 3s, and Vitamin D. Omega 3s and Coconut oil both assist with Butyrate production, which provides tremendous benefits with ""how you feel"" via its anti-inflammatory action. It also helps with weight loss and insulin sensitivity. Vitamin D is also a general fix all and something everyone should be taking. Unless you work outside for a large majority of your day, you're probably not getting enough vitamin D. 4000IU is the recommended daily allowance, so 5000IU should be fine for everyone. Vitamin D is also essential for gene functions that pertain gut flora, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways regulated via the VDR receptors. Hopefully this helps you folks with gut problems get back to guaranteed regularity, it's certainly helped me.

/u/jminuse gives a good caution to **look for review articles** when you are new to a subject.  Also, if there are multiple reviews don't forget to read the most recent one.

ALSO - **Never draw conclusions from one study.**

For example a google scholar search of [bacopa review](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bacopa+review) is a much better starting place than just random searching. (still over 7600 found)

Searching the [same with LibGen](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=bacopa+review&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives 5 results that are exactly what I was looking for.

75,"**edit:** Thanks for the Gold!

In the summer of 2012, I was returning to school, eager to get ahead, and came across [this post](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/) after doing a cursory search for 'smart drugs.' With that, my journey into the world of nootropics began.


I don't necessarily want to do a review of every substance I've tried so much as offer some insights over what I've observed, both within myself and the community these past few years.

1) **Like any community, the nootropics scene periodically undergoes trends, fads and changing consensuses.** When I first began frequenting Longecity and /r/nootropics, the general consensus was the -racetams (so long as you were a responder) represented the best risk/reward available, modafinil was the closest thing to a real world 'Limitless' drug, and a handful of other substances (e.g., pyritinol, bacopa, ALCAR, etc.) were of varying benefit. Fast forward a year or so and hype around CILTEP reached fever pitch, only to be thoroughly debunked by a popular post here. At some point in between, phenylpiracetam became more widespread at economical prices (for awhile, its high cost was a barrier), tianeptine rose from an obscure antidepressant to one of the more well-known nootropics, and uridine+DHA+choline was regarded by some as one of the best longer-term stacks. Later still, Semax, Selank et al. became household names, risk tolerances transitioned markedly from demanding a near absence of side effects to an overarching willingness to experiment with research chemicals holding little-to-no human safety evidence, and the downsides of phenibut became thoroughly entrenched in popular opinion. 3 years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if the popular discourse had changed further still.

**2) Anecdotally, I've found the best nootropics tend to be Russian.** I'm not sure whether it's arisen from a need for solutions to the resulting bran damage that high incidences of alcoholism inflicts, a scientific community more willing to pursue treatments intended to improve rather than simply treat, or something else endogenous to the culture, but invariably, my best experiences have come from Russian nootropics - e.g., phenylpiracetam, Semax, bromantane and to a lesser extent, Noopept.

**3) My responses to various substances have evolved over time.** When I first took piracetam, I felt a sense of immense clear-headedness. Now I'm lucky if I even remember taking it halfway through the day, and question whether it grants anything beyond placebo. (Evidence of benefit among healthy samples essentially boils down to a single study from the 70's; see [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426834).) Likewise, various adaptogens were godsends for my focus, energy and alertness; now, I hardly feel much of anything from the likes of ginkgo, ginseng, rhodiola, etc. Targeting micronutrient deficiencies might be at play here; unbeknownst to me at the time, I was fairly deficient in both vitamin D and B12 during my introduction to nootropics. Later lab tests uncovered both, and subsequent supplementation fixed a good deal of issues I had in terms of energy and sleep, yet coincided with a change in response to components of my stack.

**4) The often-discussed U-shaped response curve applies to nearly everything.** I recently read a post of someone complaining that this forum is excessively indulgent in prescribing exercise as the cure-all for everything, and that he had been doing so regularly and strenuously for the past few years with little in the way of benefits. Likely true. What else is true, though, especially across the current literature, is there is such a thing as both too little and too much exercise  (see [1](http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914)). Similarly, while the health food world is awash in kale-love, overconsumption might end up exposing oneself to high levels of thallium (see [2](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2015/07/kale-silent-killer)). The same can be said for excessive reliance on stimulants, high levels of supplemental antioxidants, etc. On the other hand, the benefits of quality aerobic, strength and HIIT-based workouts is insane when dosed appropriately, and has led to more personal benefits than anything else outside the concurrent use of a few select stimulants, Russian compounds, meditation and diet. In earlier times, I was on the extreme end of the spectrum when I reached a semi-elite amateur level in competitive endurance sports - and had little to show in terms of cognitive fluidity.

**5) Simple stacks are often best; distilling a stack down to its most effective components is underrated.** People (ideally) tend to transition across three stages in their nootropics journey: i) dipping one's feet in the water with a few 'starter' nootropics, e.g., caffeine + theaine, piracetam + ALCAR, etc.; ii) an aggressive experimentation phase where the aim is to figure out what works in a swift manner; and iii) a return to the basics once one determines what personally benefits them. Far too often, I read reports where someone has tried whatever the current research chemical du-jour is and writes a glowing report after < 1 week's usage, only to detail that they also take a plethora of other RC's, a few prescriptions and possibly occasional dips into pyschoactive, non-nootropic compounds. Such reports, IMO, are completely bogus with the amount of confounding factors present. The reality that doesn't get acknowledged often enough is we often have little-to-no data on long-term outcomes for even the classic nootropics, let alone combinations of such. The last place you want to be is taking 12 different things, have a debilitating side effect creep in and not have any idea where it's arising from.

**6) At some point, you have to really ask yourself about personal risk tolerances.** I think a general consensus around here is the willingness to trade long-term uncertainty for short-to-mid-term benefits. The question is, at what point does the trade-off begin to lose value? For example, could you tolerate persistent paresthesia, tinnitus, etc., if it meant improving cognition, improving anxiety, removing depression, etc.? How about a trade-off in working memory if it meant being able to memorize things photographically, perhaps to the point where you forgot what your manager just said seconds after walking away? Oftentimes, free lunches are tough to find in the world of homeostasis.

**7) Figure out your lowest-hanging fruit and target that first.** For me, figuring out a deficiency in B12 and D were godsends. Later, figuring out that I had polymorphisms at the SNP level signaling a lifelong greater need for said vitamins was enlightening as to why I became deficient in the first place despite abundant sunlight and animal product consumption. Likewise, going from a few weeks of near-complete sedentary work to 3-4 days of cardio and strength training has swift, dramatic effects on my rapidity of thought, ability to internalize technical subjects, and general mood/outlook.

**8) Know thyself - otherwise, it's easy to get caught up on others' glowing reports.** A perfect example would be tianeptine - invariably, a handful of people with debilitating depression have found immense benefits and few downsides given appropriate dosages. Said people have gone on to write glowing reports when the subject comes up. Myself, being the curious mind that I am, read such reports and decide I might like to experience said benefits myself - while momentarily neglecting that I have neither clinical depression nor the same brain chemistry as those whose posts I'm reading. Conversely, I find that nootropics that are popular among the ADHD crowd tend to have disproportionately positive effects - e.g., uridine+DHA+choline, Semax, etc. Yet modafinil is occasionally touted for its concentration-enhancing effects, and I've personally found it to be almost anti-nootropic in that I have an abundance of wakefulness but lose out on creativity, problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

**9) Some of the best nootropics are often not things you can find in a pill.** For example, when I had regular access to a sauna, I found the combination of hot and cold exposure to be immensely beneficial both for focus and sleep. When I'm in areas where natural settings are readily accessible, a few hours spent hiking leaves me thoroughly able to write well after. When I take a weekend sabbatical from smart devices, laptops, etc., I find my ability to sit down and be productive on a single task, like reading a demanding book, skyrockets. 

**10) Take breaks from time to time.** Nootropics, when they work, are awesome. Knowing your baseline is equally awesome. Saving money, even more so. Even with everything I've experimented with, I've found one of the most effective things in terms of boosting mood, productivity, rapidity of thought, etc. is strong espresso (and when the jitters arrive, a dash of theanine) after taking 3-4 weeks completely off caffeine. My response under such a scenario is almost to the point where if I could gain said benefits without the tolerance that comes from consistent use, I'd need little else. Invariably, the benefits begin decreasing after a week or so of use, and by week 3 or 4 of daily caffeine intake, the need to up dosages simply for the wakefulness aspect becomes a near-necessity. Breaks and their resultant tolerance reduction are awesome, though often highly inconvenient given a demanding work/academic schedule. When you have the chance, though, don't discount the utility of time away from the pill cabinet.",74,1439789976.0,3h8px4,291,Thoughts from Three Years in the Game,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3h8px4/thoughts_from_three_years_in_the_game/,2015-08-17 11:09:36

https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4m6mpf/feedback_on_this_nootropic/

Now many of you know that I can be very critical of new companies that pop up with unfounded claims, over the top marketing, fake reviews, no purity testing, dangerous ingredients, etc. Lately others have been starting to jump in and question things too, which is a good thing. It shows that people are starting to push for higher standards in the industry. Admittedly, I can be a bit direct in some of my criticisms. Some may even call me an asshole. However, I do it because I care about the community and the people in it. The fact that it seems like a new company selling a nootropic stack pops up every week, makes these criticisms more frequent. I want this community to be safer, grow, and advance. New vendors creating quality products, doing proper testing, and not over-marketing the shit out of things, is the way to do that. We have some really good vendors, that bring out novel quality products, and treat safety the way it should be treated. But like any other growing industry, we have a ton of people getting into it just to make money. Those are the ones that need to be called out.

Now to the direct issue of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus. Their stack was called out by a few people for a number of reasons. The most glaring of them is the fact that they claim to have almost 3 grams powders per serving, but you cannot physically fit that amount into two 00 capsules. Anybody that works with 00 capsules can immediately know something is up with those numbers. They also did not know what a COA was when asked, along with a few other issues. All very valid things to call a vendor out on. The big issue, and the reason I made this post, is that after those criticisms were raised, the owner of the company decided to threaten me with retribution if I did not delete my comments. This is a very serious issue, and needs to be addressed.

I've been threatened a few times now by other vendors, and some have even followed through on those threats, and have caused issues for me. It happens to me a lot because of how vocal I am about ridiculous things I see, and the fact that I am an easier target to lash out at. However, nobody should fear retribution from vendors for calling them out on things they see wrong. Vendors threatening any members of this community is unacceptable, but it is more common than many think. Other moderators have been threatened. Other Redditors have as well. It something that needs to be addressed. I'll provide evidence of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus's threats below, along with evidence of him following through with those threats.

At first I just decided to ignore it. I thought he would drop it after he vented his frustration with his little idle threat, and that would be it. However, then he decided to step the game up to libel and defamation, by writing a review on our Facebook wall saying that he almost died from one of our products. That took it from an idle threat, to an actual crime.

This is obviously unacceptable, and I will be contacting the Leeds police department in the UK to discuss it with them. UK libel and defamation laws are a lot more strict, and him using his real personal Facebook page makes it pretty easy to link. Making fake reviews, of almost dying no less, is not just something that the community cannot tolerate. It is an actual crime. To be clear, we will not accept vendors threatening anyone for expressing their opinions on this forum, nor anyone making threats of any kind. If a vendor threatens you, please contact us moderators, and we will help deal with it.
